Penetrance and expressivity in the molecular age
Joe¨l Zlotogora, MD, PhD
Penetrance and expressivity have been defined through clinical experience. Although penetrance is often seen as
the end of the spectrum of expressivity, penetrance and expressivity are considered as distinct phenomena. A
review of the known mechanisms underlying either penetrance or expressivity reveals that in most of the cases the
same explanation is true for both phenomena. Some of the known mechanisms include modifier genes, the
influence of the allele in trans, sex, and environmental factors. Although rapid progress has been made in
understanding of the basis of incomplete penetrance and the differences of expressivity, they still remain unknown
for most of the genetic disorders. In recent years, it has become evident that there is much in common between
the classical Mendelian traits in which the inheritance has been seen as “simple” and most of the common
diseases in which the inheritance is “complex.” In both cases genetic and/or environmental factors are acting in
a complex way. Genet Med 2003:5(5):347–352.
Key Words: penetrance, expressivity, monogenic, Mendelian inheritance
Penetrance is used to describe whether or not there is a clin-
ical expression of the genotype in the individual. Expressivity is
the term that describes the differences observed in the clinical
phenotype between two individuals with the same genotype.
With the advances in molecular genetics over the last few years,
some of the underlying mechanisms have been unraveled.
PENETRANCE
“A genotype which may or may not produce a clinical trait is
said to be incompletely penetrant.”1 The penetrance of a geno-
type is defined by the probability that a person carrying it will
present clinical manifestations. Only after a complete exami-
nation finds no clinical signs of the syndrome in an obligate
carrier, may it be concluded that the mutation is nonpenetrant
in that individual. Penetrance has been until recently a term
used almost exclusively for dominant disorders because anal-
ysis of the pedigrees alone allowed one to diagnose healthy
obligatory carriers. Incomplete penetrance was difficult to de-
tect in recessive disorders because it is enough to be a carrier to
transmit the disease. In recessive disorders, incomplete pen-
etrance was suspected only in large pedigrees when the segre-
gation ratio was significantly lower than the expected 0.25 after
correction of the ascertainment bias. Recently, the existence of
healthy homozygotes of recessive disorders has been demon-
strated by molecular analysis showing that incomplete pen-
etrance is also relevant in recessive disorders (Table 1).
“Pseudo-incomplete penetrance”
The definition of nonpenetrance depends upon the accuracy
of the clinical phenotype analysis. In some cases, the observa-
tion of nonpenetrance is inaccurate because the clinical exam-
ination is incomplete, or the symptoms have not yet appeared
at the time of the examination. Germ line mosaicism is a par-
ticular example of pseudo-incomplete penetrance that is seen
only in the first generation when the parents of several children
affected with a dominant disease are healthy. The absence of
symptoms in the parents is due to the presence of a mutation in
the germ cells with or without a mosaicism in the somatic
cells.2
Facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy
Facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy is an autosomal
dominant disease with progressive muscular weakness with a
characteristic pattern of involvement.3 More than 90% of the
patients demonstrate clinical symptoms by the age of 20 years
with higher penetrance in males. The disease is often caused by
rearrangements in the gene FSHD1A. Several families have
been reported in which both healthy parents with no familial
history had more than one affected child. Molecular studies
demonstrated that one of the healthy parents carried the mu-
tation as a mosaicism in the germ line.2
Premutation
The incomplete penetrance in this case is due to the exis-
tence of an intermediate state of the mutation, with no clinical
expression. The mutation may change from one generation to
another and therefore a normal individual with a premutation
may have several affected children in whom the mutation is
fully penetrant. The hallmark of this type of inheritance is that
incomplete penetrance is present only in the early generations

whereas subsequent generations of affected individuals will
show complete penetrance in their children.
Fragile X syndrome
The fragile X syndrome is the most common form of X-
linked mental retardation. The clinical expression of the dis-
ease is variable with mental retardation being the most com-
mon feature. In general, mental retardation is more severe in
the affected males than in the affected females. The observation
that many obligatory carriers in families with the fragile X syn-
drome are healthy was made before the knowledge of its mo-
lecular basis. Sherman et al.4 reported the paradoxical obser-
vation that among the children of normal carriers, the risk for
mental retardation depends upon the sex of the carrier parent.
Whereas the children of female carriers are often mentally re-
tarded, the daughters of normal transmitting males are normal
even though they are obligatory carriers of the mutation. The
incomplete penetrance has been explained after the cloning of
the FMR1 gene by the existence of premutation carriers who
are clinically normal.5 The premutation expands to a full mu-
tation almost exclusively through a female carrier.
Sex limitation
For some mutations, the clinical symptoms are present only
in one sex. Sex limitation is often seen in disorders in which the
expression of the disease is limited to organs found in only one
of the sexes, such testis or ovaries.
Steroid 5� reductase deficiency
This is an autosomal recessive disorder in which the ho-
mozygous females are normal and the homozygous males are
either born with ambiguous genitalia or almost normal exter-
nal female genitalia.6 During childhood the affected boys un-
dergo various degrees of virilization. The mutated enzyme 5�
reductase catalyzes the conversion of testosterone to dehy-
drotestosterone in androgen sensitive tissues. Therefore, al-
though affected males will present with abnormal external gen-
italia, the affected females will be normal.
Influence of the allele in trans
In a dominant disorder, the clinical phenotype is present in
the heterozygote. Either a polymorphism or a mutation of the
allele in trans may lead to the incomplete penetrance of the
dominant mutation.
Retinitis pigmentosa
Progressive visual loss, night blindness, and pigmentary
deposition in the retina characterize retinitis pigmentosa. Ret-
initis pigmentosa is genetically heterogeneous and has been
associated with many genetic loci.7 In autosomal dominant
retinitis pigmentosa due to mutations at the locus RP 11
(19q13.4, gene RPP31), the penetrance is incomplete. A segre-
gation study in families with a RP11 mutation demonstrated
that the segregation of the allele from the noncarrier parent is
not at random.8 This observation was highly significant and
strongly suggests an influence of the wild-type allele on the
expression of the mutated allele.
Autosomal-dominant glaucoma
Glaucoma is a leading cause of blindness and is usually clas-
sified according to the anatomy and/or the age of onset. As a
rule, the earlier the onset, the more severe the visual impair-
ment. In a large pedigree with autosomal-dominant glaucoma
caused by a mutation in the MYOC (TIGR) gene, several ho-
mozygotes for the mutation were diagnosed by molecular
studies among the children of two affected individuals.9 None
of these children had any clinical symptoms of glaucoma. This
was significantly different from the expected as observed in the
other adult carriers of the mutation in the family when ad-
justed for age. This finding is probably secondary to a domi-
nant-negative effect of the mutation.
Influence of a modifier gene
The presence of a mutation/polymorphism at a locus differ-
ent from the one causing the disease may alter the effect of the
mutation and prevent its clinical manifestations.
Autosomal-recessive deafness DFNB26
Many different gene loci have been reported to be responsi-
ble for nonsyndromic autosomal recessive hearing loss. In a
large pedigree with autosomal-recessive deafness, linkage to
the chromosomal region 4q31 was demonstrated.10 However,
whereas all the affected individuals were homozygous for the
same haplotype, homozygosity was also found in many unaf-
fected siblings. By linkage analysis, the authors were able to
demonstrate the existence of a dominant modifier (DFNM1)
on chromosome 1q24. The presence of this modifier in an
individual homozygous for the DFNB26 mutation leads to
nonpenetrance and normal hearing.
Digenic inheritance
The term digenic inheritance was proposed to describe a
situation in which the clinical expression depends upon the
presence of two mutations in two different genes.
Retinitis pigmentosa
Mutations in the gene peripherin RDS are responsible for
either autosomal recessive or dominant retinitis pigmentosa.11

In several families with a dominant form of retinitis pigmen-
tosa, the mutation L185P in the RDS gene was nonpenetrant in
many carriers that were detected by molecular analysis. It was
demonstrated later that all the individuals affected with retini-
tis pigmentosa were also carriers of a mutation in another un-
linked gene ROM1. Both carriers of a single mutation, either
L185P in periferin/RDS, or a null mutation in ROM1 were
healthy. Only the carriers of both mutations (double heterozy-
gotes) were clinically affected with retinitis pigmentosa.12 The
explanation for these observations is that the encoded proteins
of peripherin/RDS and ROM1 form homodimers that interact
covalently with each other.13 Therefore, mutations in one allele
of each of the genes lead to an abnormal complex and eventu-
ally to retinitis pigmentosa.
Bardet Biedl syndrome
Bardet Biedl syndrome (BBS) is an autosomal-recessive disor-
derincludingmentalretardation,obesity,polydactyly,andretinal
degeneration.14Atleast7differentlociareknownandsomeofthe
genes responsible have been characterized. Although segregation
analyses in large families were compatible with a classical autoso-
mal recessive inheritance, it seems that the picture may be more
complicated.Severalofthepatientswerefoundtobehomozygous
at one of the BBS loci and heterozygous at another BBS locus.15
This digenic inheritance was referred as triallelic because it is a
recessive disorder and the patients carry three mutations. This
type of inheritance is responsible for some of the BBS cases, and it
has been proposed that it may represent a more general explana-
tion for some syndromes.15
Imprinting
Both parental genomes are essential for normal growth and
development. In mice and later in humans, it was demon-
strated that some of the genes are imprinted, expressed only
from either the maternal or paternal chromosome. A mutation
in one of these imprinted genes will be expressed only if present
on the chromosome from the parent who transmits the active
copy of the gene.
Angelman syndrome
Angelman syndrome is a disorder characterized by mental
retardation, happy disposition, bursts of laugher, puppet-like
movements, and wide-based gait.16 The syndrome may be
caused by a deletion or uniparental disomy of the region
15q11-q13 or by a mutation in the UBE3A gene. Carriers of
mutations in the UBE3A gene may or may not present clinical
symptoms depending upon the parent from whom they re-
ceived the mutation.17 Only children who received the muta-
tion from their mother present with symptoms of the syn-
drome. Those children who received the mutation from their
father are unaffected, but if they are females, they may transmit
the disease to their offspring.
Influence of environmental factors
For some mutations, the affected individuals present symp-
toms only after exposure to an environmental factor.
Aminoglycoside-induced mitochondrial deafness
Familial occurrence of hearing loss after a modest dose of
streptomycin along with a mitochondrial inheritance has been
observed in several families.18 The carriers of the mutation
A1555G of the 12sRNA in the mitochondrial DNA are normal
and only if there is a second event, such as exposure to amino-
glycosides, will the individual be affected. Another probable
second event is a mutation in the nuclear DNA. In several
families, congenital deafness was observed without evident ex-
posure to drugs, and linkage analysis suggested the existence of
a modifier on chromosome 8.19
EXPRESSIVITY: DIFFERENCES IN THE SAME PHENOTYPE
Mutations in the same gene may cause different clinical
symptoms and two different groups of expressivity may be
distinguished. The same molecular genotype may present dif-
ferences in either the severity of the same clinical phenotype or
differences in the clinical presentation. It is probable that in
many cases the combined influence of genetic and environ-
mental factors leads to the difference in expressivity (Table 2).
“Pseudo” differences in expressivity
Homozygotization of a dominant mutation may give the
impression of differences in expressivity because the pheno-
type of the homozygote is often more severe than the one of the
heterozygote. In a family in which an affected individual pre-
sents with a severe form of a dominant disease, the possibility
of homozygotization may be envisaged if both parents present
symptoms. However, this possibility may not be evident either
because of incomplete penetrance in one of the parents or uni-
parental disomy in the child.

Waardenburg syndrome
Waardenburg syndrome type I is an autosomal-dominant dis-
orderwiththeclassicaltriadofdeafness,pigmentarychangessuch
as a white forelock, and dystopia canthorum.20 In a consanguin-
eous couple with a family history of deafness, their first child pre-
sented with the classical form of Waardenburg syndrome includ-
ing a white lock and dystopia canthorum.21 The second child was
born with a very severe form of the syndrome suggesting variable
expressivity. However, clinical examination of the parents re-
vealed that both had dystopia canthorum and were therefore af-
fected.Theseobservationssuggestedthepossibilityofhomozygo-
tizationofthechildthatwasdemonstratedbymolecularstudies.21
Influence of a polymorphism present in cis
Several polymorphisms/mild mutations have been reported
that if they are combined in cis they may lead to a severe
phenotype.
Cystic fibrosis
Patients with the genotype DeltaF508/R347H-D979A are af-
fected with a severe form of cystic fibrosis including pancreatic
insufficiency and severe pulmonary manifestations. However,
the individual mutations R347H and D979A in the CFTR gene
are known to be mild and as suggested by the clinical observa-
tions, when combined in cis they act as a severe mutation.
When these mutants were transiently expressed in HeLa cells,
R347H was associated with defective chloride activity and
D979A lead to misprocessing.22 The mutant R347H-D979A
expressed both defects and dramatically reduced the chloride
channel activity.
Influence of the allele in trans
Either a polymorphism or a mutation in the allele in trans may
lead to the difference in the expressivity of a dominant mutation.
Elliptocytosis
Elliptocytosis is an autosomal-dominant hematological dis-
order characterized by elliptically shaped erythrocytes and he-
molytic anemia.23 The disorder results from mutations in one
of the genes encoding for the red cell membrane skeleton in
particular the �- and the �-spectrin genes. A relatively com-
mon polymorphism lowers the �-spectrin gene expression (LE
allele). Therefore when the LE allele is present in cis of the
mutation for elliptocytosis, the product of the double hetero-
zygote allele will be rejected and only the product of the normal
allele will be incorporated. In this case, the polymorphism res-
cues the individual from the elliptocytosis mutation. However,
if the LE allele is present in trans of a mutation for elliptocyto-
sis, it will result in a more severe clinical picture than the one
found in patients with the mutation alone.24
Influence of another gene
The clinical presentation of a monogenic disorder may de-
pend upon the presence of a mutation in another gene.
Dominant glaucoma
Mutations in the two genes MYOC and CYP1B1 have been
characterized in some forms of glaucoma: MYOC in autosom-
al-dominant open angle glaucoma and CYP1B1 in recessive
congenital glaucoma.25,26 In a single large family, several indi-
viduals affected with dominant glaucoma had mutations in
both MYOC and CYP1B1.27 The clinical presentation was dif-
ferent for patients with a MYOC mutation alone (mean age of
onset 51 years) or when the mutation was present together
with a CYP1B1 mutation (mean age of onset 27 years). These
observations suggested that CYP1B1 acts as a modifier of
MYOC and that the two genes interact through a common
pathway.
Anticipation
Anticipation is a term used to describe the transmission of a
dominant disorder with an earlier onset and more severe man-
ifestations from one generation to the next.
Myotonic dystrophy
Myotonic dystrophy is an autosomal-dominant disorder
with a wide range of clinical symptoms. The major clinical
features include myotonia, cataracts, hypogonadism, frontal
balding, and electrocardiographic changes. Some of the pa-
tients also present with mental retardation. Anticipation was,
at first, a clinical observation but that has been challenged, and
it was thought to represent a selection bias. Later studies of
families after exclusion of the index patients demonstrated an
earlier onset and more severe phenotype among children of
almost all of the parent-child pairs.27 At the molecular level, the
disorders in which clinical anticipation is present are caused by
dynamic mutations with anticipation being, at least in part,
related to the expansion of the repeat number.28
Influence of the sex
The clinical presentation of a monogenic disorder may de-
pend upon the sex of the affected individual. In some cases, a
particular clinical symptom may be present in one sex only.
Cystic fibrosis
Among affected individuals females are usually fertile and
males infertile because of bilateral aplasia of the vas deferens.29
Congenital bilateral aplasia of the vas deferens is not a devel-
opmental anomaly but a degenerative change of the vas defer-
ens in males due to an obstruction similar to that which occurs
in cystic fibrosis in the pancreas and other organs.
Somatic mosaicism
The presence of a mutation as a somatic and germinal mo-
saicism often leads to a milder phenotype in the affected indi-
vidual than in his children.2 The affected children present a
more severe form of the disorder because the mutation is
present in all of their cells.

Osteogenesis imperfecta type II
Osteogenesis imperfecta is a heterogeneous group of disor-
ders of the connective tissue characterized mainly by bone fra-
gility and blue sclerae. Type II or osteogenesis imperfecta con-
genita is a lethal autosomal-dominant disease. Several families
have been reported in which individuals with a mild/moderate
form of osteogenesis imperfecta had a child with the lethal
form.2 Molecular analysis demonstrated that the differences in
the clinical presentation were due to the presence of the muta-
tion only as a mosaicism in the parent.
Environmental factors
In many metabolic diseases, the clinical presentation may
depend upon the quantity of substrate in the diet.
Hereditary fructose intolerance
Many of the cases of fructose intolerance are severely ill in-
fants with recurrent hypoglycemia and vomiting.30 This usu-
ally occurs at the time of weaning when fructose or sucrose is
added to the diet and results in marked malnutrition. How-
ever, in some cases when fructose is added later and/or in small
quantities, the symptoms may be much milder, with a general
marked aversion to sweets and fruits.
EXPRESSIVITY: DIFFERENCES IN THE CLINICAL
PRESENTATION
Molecular heterogeneity
In some cases, the differences in the clinical presentation are
secondary to molecular heterogeneity. Some mutations are re-
sponsible for a more severe phenotype, whereas other muta-
tions lead to a milder phenotype.
Tay Sachs disease
Tay Sachs disease is due to the deficiency of the lysosomal
enzyme hexosaminidase A.31 Complete absence of the enzyme
may be secondary to several mutations that in homozygosity or
compound heterozygosity leads to the severe infantile form of
the disease. Other mutations allow for the synthesis of an en-
zyme with some residual activity and therefore are responsible
for a milder form of the disease usually with adult onset.31
Influence of a polymorphism in cis
A dominant mutation may lead to different phenotypes de-
pending upon the type of polymorphism present in the same
gene in cis.
Creutzfeld-Jakob disease and Fatal Familial Insomnia
Both Creutzfeld-Jakob disease and Fatal Familial Insomnia
are rare, autosomal-dominant, phenotypically distinct, and
progressive neurological disorders. Although no sleep impair-
ment has been reported in Creutzfeld-Jakob disease, the same
mutation at codon 178 of the prion protein gene is responsible
for both Creutzfeld-Jakob disease and Fatal Familial Insomnia.
A different segregation of the valine-methionine polymor-
phism in codon 129 was demonstrated in each of the two dis-
eases (valine in Creutzfeld-Jakob disease and methionine in
Fatal Familial Insomnia).32 Each different combination of the
mutation at codon 178 and the polymorphism in codon 129
produce different conformations of the prion protein with dif-
ferent protease cleavage sites. As a result the abnormal iso-
forms of the prion protein differ both in the relative abundance
of the glycosylated forms and in the size of the protein resistant
fragments.
Imprinting
According to the parent who transmits the mutation, a dif-
ferent clinical presentation may be observed.
Progressive osseous heteroplasia and Albright’s hereditary
osteodystrophy
Progressive osseous heteroplasia is a disease including clas-
sically congenital malformations of the big toe and progressive
heterotopic ossification of the skeletal muscles, tendons, liga-
ments, and fascia.33 Patients affected with Albright’s hereditary
osteodystrophy have short stature obesity, round face, short
fourth metacarpal bones, and often subcutaneous calcifica-
tions.34 In one family, the same mutation in the GNAS1 gene
caused either progressive osseous heteroplasia when mater-
nally inherited or Albright’s hereditary osteodystrophy when
paternally inherited.35 Although several speculations have
been proposed, the mechanism is still not understood.
Somatic mosaicism
The clinical syndrome may be different when the same mu-
tation is present as a somatic mosaicism or in all the body cells.
Epidermal nevus and epidermolytic hyperkeratosis
Epidermal nevi frequently appear at birth or shortly after.
Somatic mosaicism for a mutation in the gene for keratin 10 is
responsible for some epidermal nevi.36 Mutations in the same
gene also cause epidermolytic hyperkeratosis, which is a gen-
eralized dermatological disease. Several families have been re-
ported in whom a child was affected with epidermolytic hyper-
keratosis due to a keratin 10 mutation in all the cells, whereas
an epidermal nevus was found in the parent with the mutation
present only in a mosaic state.
CONCLUSION
Nonpenetrance and differences in expressivity of mono-
genic disorders in humans have been delineated very early in
medical genetics. With the ability to understand the molecular
basis for many monogenic diseases, some of the basic processes
leading to nonpenetrance and differences in expressivity be-
came clear. Still, for most of the cases, the complete mecha-
nisms explaining either nonpenetrance or differences in ex-
pressivity are not understood. Understanding the complexity
of the factors leading to nonpenetrance or differences in ex-
pressivity in “simple” monogenic traits will serve as a model for
revealing the basis of complex traits.

Although the influence of modifiers and environmental fac-
tors on monogenic disorders has been suspected, it is only
recently that their molecular basis has begun to be understood.
In many other cases, the mechanisms such as imprinting, di-
genic inheritance, or expanding mutations came as a surprise
to the medical geneticists, even though they have been previ-
ously described in other organisms.
Almost all the mechanisms to nonpenetrance and expressiv-
ity are common; however, the distinction between the two
phenomena is still important for genetic counseling. Because
Neurofibromatosis type I is a disease with complete pen-
etrance, the demonstration that the parents of an affected child
have no clinical symptoms allow giving them a very small re-
currence risk.2
Understanding the basis for incomplete penetrance in some
of the genetic diseases may be the key to prevent their symp-
toms. For instance, in BRCA2–6174delT Ashkenazi Jewish
carriers, the presence of the RAD51-135C allele results in an
approximately 4-fold increase in breast cancer risk.37 The bio-
logical effect of the polymorphism is not yet known, but it has
been suggested that the RAD51 status might be useful in dif-
ferentiating those carriers most likely to benefit from aggres-
sive prevention measures from those in whom more conserva-
tive management would be appropriate. The elucidation of the
mechanisms protecting carriers of BRCA mutations from de-
veloping cancer may help to develop appropriate preventive
drugs.25,30
