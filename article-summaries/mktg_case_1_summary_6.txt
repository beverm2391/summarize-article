LANDS’ END IN 2015 
Lands’ End was founded in 1963 by Gary Comer as a mail-order yachting equipment company.3  
The company started selling casual clothing for men and women in 1976 and became a public 
company in 1992.4 In 2002, Sears Holding Corporation (Sears) purchased Lands’ End for $1.9 billion;5  
however, due to disappointing sales at Sears stores that carried Lands’ End merchandise,6 in 2014 
Sears spun off Lands’ End as an independent publicly traded company again.7    As such, by early 2015 
Lands’ End was once again its own entity with a new CEO: Edgar Huber (previously President of J.Crew).8     At the time of the spinoff from Sears, Huber stated that he wanted to focus on three things: firstly on reestablishing relationships with core customers; secondly on rebuilding trust with employees; and thirdly on regaining market share lost during the years it had been part of Sears.9     To this end he embarked on a journey to “make [Lands’ End] great again!10 ” This entailed creating what he called a “customer obsessed culture11 , ” which would be based around five pillars: quality without compromise; amazing service every day; style you can count on; value always worth it;12 and doing good business while doing good deeds13 —the last two being very much aligned with the brand values set out by founder Gary Comer when he started the company 50 years earlier (see Exhibit 1).14      Underpinning these pillars were four key strategies that would help achieve success: firstly improving product quality across all categories through better design and materials selection processes15 ; secondly increasing customer engagement16 ; thirdly growing digital capabilities17 ; fourthly expanding international reach18 ; fifthly revitalizing brick-and-mortar retail19 ; sixthly investing in technology20 ; seventhly developing innovative marketing initiatives21 ; eighthly building strong relationships with vendors22 ; ninthly attracting top talent23 .    The goal was to make sure that each touch point along the customer journey delivered an exceptional experience so that they would want to buy more products from Lands’ End or recommend them to others24 .          2 Ibid 3 http://www.landsendbusinessoutfitters.com/about_us/history 4 Ibid 5 http://fortune.com/2002/06/03/sears-buys-lands-end 6 https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424127887323864604578557504240731748 7 http://fortune.com/2014/04/28/sears-spins-off-landsend 8 https://www2bwxtnpnv0lzq93g3ypd4bfmfkpvzil2gbxrqtzkmxptnzlmvzdmlkcgf0aw5nlcmfuemlnbmlldmllcy53c29jb250ZW50Lndpa2ltZWRpYS5jb20vdXBsb2Fkcy90aHVtbmNhdGlvbi8yMDE1LTExLTExVDIwOjUyOjE0KzAwOjAwaDQxYTJhODRiNDYwOTQ3MDhmMWUyNGJhOWM1NDA4OGEyNWUuanBnP2ltYWdlSWQ9MTIxNTgzMA== 9 Interviews with former employees 10 Interviews with former employees 11 Ibid 12 Ibid 13 Ibid 14 See Exhibit 1 15 Interviews 16 Interviews 17 Interviews 18 Interviews 19 Interviews 20Interview 21Interview 22Interview 23Interview 24Interview



 Federica Marchionni joined Lands'End as CEO in July 2015 charged with driving growth for the iconic American apparel brand known for its quality affordable clothing items like school uniforms jeans outerwear swimsuits and home goodsURIComponent(y=new Date,y.getFullYear()); he wanted to build a company that 
would be different—a company based on the Golden Rule (“Do unto others as you would have 
them do unto you”). The company’s purpose was “to help customers achieve their dreams and 
aspirations through products and services that inspire, enable, and deliver lasting value.” This 
purpose had not changed over time; it was still very much alive in the company culture.   What 
had changed was how the company went about achieving its purpose in a rapidly changing world. 
Marchionni believed that if she could get everyone at Lands’ End to buy into the idea of leading with 
purpose, they would be more engaged and committed to taking the necessary actions to achieve it—and feel proud to work for such a great company.    She also realized that this would require some changes in mindset and behavior within the organization.     To make her case, Marchionni shared stories about other companies that had been successful in making this shift, including Patagonia, Nike, REI, and Lululemon Athletica. These companies all had one thing in common: They were able to stay true to their core values while adapting their business models to meet changing customer needs—and they were doing it profitably.    Marchionni also emphasized that being a purpose-driven company did not mean sacrificing profitability or shareholder value; rather, it meant finding new ways of doing business that would create long-term sustainable growth for all stakeholders—employees, customers, shareholders, suppliers, communities, and society at large.
 
and was made of a lightweight fabric that could be dressed up or down.  The dress was 
available in sizes 0 to 18, with plus sizes available online, and sold for $99.50.  It quickly sold 
out and became one of the most popular items on social media, with Lands’ End customers 
posting photos of themselves wearing the dress on vacation, at weddings, and even to work.

with demand by manufacturing more dresses and making them available in stores as well as 
online.3    This case study looks at how Lands’ End used design thinking principles to turnaround its business under new CEO Federica Marchionni.

reinvigorating its product assortment, design, and quality.  The company also needed to ensure 
that it was designing products with an understanding of how customers actually lived their lives.

and start thinking about design in a more customer-centric way.   
In order to achieve this goal, Lands’ End embarked on a journey to understand how customers 
lived their lives and what they really wanted from their clothing.  The company conducted over 
100 customer interviews and spent time observing customers in their homes, at work, and on 
vacation.  What Lands’ End discovered was that while many of its core customers loved the brand, 
they didn’t always feel that the clothes were relevant to their lives.  In response, Lands’ End set out 
to design a new collection of casual classics that were both stylish and practical.
