rents was a germ-line mosaic for the FSHD1A mutation.4 In
such cases, the penetrance is not 100% because not all of the
offspring will inherit the mutant allele from the healthy parent.
EXPRESSIVITY
The expression of a phenotype is determined by many factors,
including environmental influences and modifier genes. The
expression of a phenotype can also be different in different or-
gans. For example, retinoblastoma (an eye tumor) can be due to a
germ-line mutation in RB1, but other tumors such as osteosarcoma
(bone cancer) are not associated with this gene.5 The pheno-type of a disease may also vary within a family. Huntington’s disease,
for example, has variable expressivity even within one fami-
group, the autosomal-dominant glaucomas are rare. The most
common type of autosomal-dominant glaucoma is juvenile
open-angle glaucoma.9 In this disorder, there is a high intraocu-
lar pressure and progressive optic nerve damage. The gene
responsible for juvenile open-angle glaucoma has not been iden-
tified. However, linkage studies have identified several loci
that are associated with the disease.10 One such locus is on chro-
one parental allele.16 The best-known example is the
gene for insulin-like growth factor 2 (IGF2), which is expressed
from the paternal allele in mice but from the maternal allele
in humans.17 Mice carrying a mutation in the IGF2 gene that pre-
vents its expression from the paternal allele are normal, while
humans carrying this same mutation have severe growth retarda-
tion. This difference is due to imprinting of the IGF2 gene. ion of the mutation in the family.

This article discusses different ways that a mutation may cause differences in expressivity. For example, a mutation may cause different symptoms in different people or two groups of people with the same molecular genotype may present different symptoms.rosis
The most common mutation in cystic fibrosis, DeltaF508, is
present in about 70% of all patients with the disorder. How-
ever, the clinical manifestations of the disease vary consid-
erably between men and women. In men, the most common
symptoms are pulmonary infection and pancreatic insuffi-
ciency. In contrast, women are more likely to have infertility,
menstrual irregularities, and a milder form of pulmonary dis-ease.29 This difference in phenotype between men and women is
probably due to differences in the expression of the CFTR gene
between the sexes.

Progressive osseous heteroplasia is a rare autosomal-dominant
condition characterized by the progressive replacement of nor-
mal bone with fibrous tissue.33 Albright’s syndrome is asso-
ciated with increased production of estrogen and is charac-
terized by obesity, gynecomastia, and pseudohyperplastic endo-
metrium.33 The two conditions are caused by mutations in the
gene encoding for the alpha subunit of the stimulatory G protein
(Gs alpha). In progressive osseous heteroplasia, the mutation is
